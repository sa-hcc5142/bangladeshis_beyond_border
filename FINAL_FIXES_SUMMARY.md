## Overview
This document summarizes all the corrections made to address the remaining issues in the website.

## ‚úÖ Fix 1: Gradient Background Correction
**Issue**: The header gradients on university detail pages didn't match the "World University Rankings 2025" gradient from the rankings page.

**Solution**: Updated all 5 university pages to use the exact same gradient:
- **Correct Gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #127083 0%, #38bdf8 100%)`

**Files Updated**:
1. `resources/views/rankings/show.blade.php` - University profile page
2. `resources/views/university/alumni.blade.php` - Alumni & Faculty page
3. `resources/views/university/research.blade.php` - Research Opportunities page
4. `resources/views/university/residential.blade.php` - Residential Facility page
5. `resources/views/university/jobs.blade.php` - Part-time Job Opportunities page

**Result**: All pages now have consistent cyan-to-blue gradient matching the rankings page.

## ‚úÖ Fix 2: Campus Tour Guide Image Replacement
**Issue**: The Campus Tour Guide job card image wasn't loading correctly.

**Solution**: Replaced the broken image URL with a working Unsplash image.
- **Old URL**: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523050854058-8df90110c9f1?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop`
- **New URL**: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541339907198-e08756dedf3f?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop`

**File Updated**: `resources/views/university/jobs.blade.php`

**Result**: Campus Tour Guide card now displays a proper group of students image.

## ‚úÖ Fix 3: "Edit on GitHub" Section Separation
**Issue**: The "Edit on GitHub" section was part of the footer, not visually separated.

**Solution**: Moved the "Edit on GitHub" CTA to a separate section above the footer:
- Added `mt-20 mb-8` margins for spacing
- Added `rounded-2xl` for better visual separation
- Added `mx-4` for side margins
- Kept the same styling and content

**File Updated**: `resources/views/layouts/main.blade.php`

**Result**: "Edit on GitHub" section now appears as a distinct call-to-action box above the footer.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 4: Navigation Bar - Contribute Link Repositioned
**Issue**: "Contribute" link was in the main navigation with other pages, should be next to GitHub icon.

**Solution**: 
- Removed "Contribute" from main navigation links (left side)
- Added "Contribute" to Auth Buttons section (right side)
- Positioned it just left of the GitHub icon
- Added `hidden lg:block` to match navbar responsiveness

**File Updated**: `resources/views/layouts/main.blade.php`

**Result**: Navigation bar now shows: Home | Rankings | By Subject | Countries | Blog on the left, and Contribute | GitHub icon | Login on the right.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 5: Text Visibility (Already Completed)
**Status**: Text visibility on Performance Metrics, Quick Actions, and Explore cards was already improved in previous updates.

**Current State**:
- Performance Metrics cards: Bold numbers (e.g., `text-blue-700`, `text-green-700`) with dark gray labels (`text-gray-900 font-semibold`)
- Quick Actions cards: Bold titles (`text-gray-900`) with medium-weight descriptions (`text-gray-800 text-sm font-medium`)
- Explore cards: Bold titles (`text-gray-900`) with medium-weight descriptions (`text-gray-800 font-medium`)

**Result**: All card text is highly visible with proper contrast and font weights.

## ‚úÖ Fix 6: Federal Work-Study Text (Already Completed)
**Status**: Text visibility in the Federal Work-Study section was already improved in previous updates.

**Current State**:
- Title: `text-xl font-bold text-gray-900`
- Description: `text-gray-900 font-medium`
- Link: `text-blue-700 font-bold`

**Result**: All text in the Federal Work-Study info box is clearly visible.
